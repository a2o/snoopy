  Snoopy Logger ChangeLog
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2015-05-11 - Version 2.3.0
--------------------------
o Feature: new data source: datetime (returns current date and time in
    ISO8601 format).
o Feature (#54 @ GitHub): new data sources: timestamp, timestamp_ms and timestamp_us
o Feature (#55 @ GitHub): file output is now configurable with ./configure flag
    --with-default-output=OUTPUT_SPEC.
o Feature (#53 @ GitHub): file output provider implemented. Snoopy is now capable of logging
    directly to file, if filesystem permissions do not prevent it.
o Bugfixes: resolved all nine Coverity bugs (#80899-#80909), covering various
    resource leaks, unchecked string writes etc.
o Bugfixes: resolved six additional coverity bugs (82437-82442)
o Refactoring build process: config file comments now reflect which data
    sources, filters and outputs are available in given Snoopy installation/
    package/build.
o Refactoring build process: all data sources, filters and outputs can now be
    enabled/disabled individually by ./configure flags. This should make Snoopy
    less vulnerable if securing installation by reducing attack surface is
    desired. Each group (data sources, filters and outputs) can also be
    disabled with a single --enable-all-* ./configure flag.
o Refactoring build process: removed all stale files which are copied/symlinked
    by autoreconf; updated makefiles to enable building outside of source tree;
    renamed some outputs to maintain naming consistency; reduced complexity and
    size of configure.ac by abstracting certain functionality into dedicated
    macros; moved as many build-time files as possible from root into
    build/aux/ directory;
o Enhancement: specify in debian build recipe that libsnoopy package is to
    supersed old 'snoopy' package.
    (Contributed by Frederic Mora)
o Refactoring: do not include filtering code if filtering is not enabled on
    ./configure line.
o Refactoring #50 (GitHub): change ./configure flag --enable-filter to
    --enable-filtering, to prepare Snoopy for future changes (per-datasource,
    per-filter and per-output configure flags).
o Bug #49 (GitHub): reset configuration values back to their corresponding
    defaults when running final cleanup. This prevents buffer overflows on
    next Snoopy invocations when config file is not found anymore.
o Enhancement #48: do not include code for config file in the final library
    when config file is not enabled at all (via ./configure argument).
o Feature #45: new filter that excludes snoopy log entries from certain
    processes.
    (Code contributed by Frederic Mora)
o Bug #44 / Enhancement #42: upgraded iniparser compotent to latest git
    version, the one that was included before was causing problems in
    threaded environments (java).
o Refactoring #41: change term "input provider" to "data source", to more
    accurately reflect what is actually going on in that part of code.
o Enhancement #42: upgraded included iniparser component to latest git version.
    This hopefully resolves issues with threaded processes.
o Repository refactoring: removed all files that are created/copied by
    autotools suite, and added them to gitignore.
o Include documentation in release packages from now on.


2015-04-27 - Version  2.2.8
---------------------------
o Bugfix #39: prevent double freeing of message_format and filter_chain
    variables when snoopy.ini suddenly disappears from filesystem.
    (reported by Ariel Zach)
o Bugfix #39-2: Fix invalid parsing in rpname input provider - check the line
    that is read from /proc/PID/status and verify that it is non-empty and that
    it actually contains colon character before attempting to parse it.
    (reported and initial fix authored by Ariel Zach)
o Bugfix #46: prevent bufffer overflow in cmdline input provider
    (reported by Ariel Zach)
o Bugfix and refactoring: rpname input provider was leaking some memory, and
    it was made more logically structured (variables and if conditions were
    changed to more logical and coherent naming, to align it better with the
    rest of Snoopy code).
o Bugfix #47: Bugfix #39 inadvertently introduced a doublefree bug when
    filter chain was specified in snoopy.ini.
    (reported by Ariel Zach)


2015-03-26 - Version  2.2.7
---------------------------
o Feature: added new input provider %{rpname} - gets root process name
    (submitted by Ariel Zach)


2015-03-06 - Version  2.2.6
---------------------------
o Feature: added new input provider %{env_all} - logs whole environment
o Feature: added new input provider %{pid} - provides process id
o Feature: added new input provider %{ppid} - provides parent process id
o Bugfix: Fixed improper return value checking in all input providers that
    work with literal usernames and groups. This was causing shutdown hangs on
    RH/CentOS 7 systems that use systemd, with additional special conitions:
    - compiled-in message_format must have included these input providers,
    - when only configured in snoopy.ini, they did not trigger this bug.


2015-03-04 - Version  2.2.5
---------------------------
o Bugfix: devlog output provider was not resetting configuration to original
    values after it called socket output provider as its subroutine.
o Bugfix: added support for 'make install DESTDIR=...' in etc/Makefile.am
o Bugfix: fixed installation of snoopy.ini in nonexistent directory


2015-01-27 - Version  2.2.4
---------------------------
o Bugfix: devlog output was not implemented properly, it was missing log
    facility and log level specification. This resulted in Snoopy output
    appearing on user's console, as everything was treated with EMERG
    severity. On CentOS/RH messages of this severity are forwarded to console
    by default.
o Bugfix: Install configuration file with .NEW suffix, and warn the user.


2015-01-27 - Version  2.2.3
---------------------------
o Bugfix: fixed compilation issues on pre 2.09 glibc platforms
    (SOCK_NONBLOCK, SOCK_CLOEXEC missing)


2015-01-20 - Version  2.2.2
---------------------------
o Bugfix: fixed compilation issues on pre 2.12 glibc platforms (getsid)


2015-01-11 - Version  2.2.1
---------------------------
o Feature: added support for configurable output selection
o Feature: added dummy input provider: snoopy_version
o Bugfix: changed default output provider from syslog to devlog (non-blocking
    socket as workaround for systemd's buffered/blocking /dev/log socket)


2015-01-11 - Version  2.2.0
---------------------------
o Never released.


2014-11-08 - Version  2.1.0
---------------------------
o Enhancement: strict checking of ./configure --with-syslog-* values
o Enhancement: enabled configuration of syslog facility and level from
    configuration file


2014-11-07 - Version  2.0.1
---------------------------
o Bugfix: fixed uninitialized pointer in filter/exclude_uid.c and only_uid.c
o Enhancement: prefix all iniparser errors with "SNOOPY " prefix, so it is
    evident where errors are coming from
o Bugfix: changed --with-config-file to --enable-config-file. Having two ways
    to specify where configuration file exists is redundant and confusing.


2014-11-05 - Version  2.0.0
---------------------------
o Feature: Added support for custom message format specification at
    configuration time
o Feature: New input providers:
    - egroup       (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - env          (thanks Taylor Kimball)
    - eusername    (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - group        (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - login        (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - username     (thanks Sébastien Gross)
    - tty_uid      (thanks Tony Malkowski)
    - tty_username
o Feature: Implemented internal filtering, with the following filters available:
    - exclude_uid
    - only_root
    - only_uid
o Feature: Added optional support for INI configuration file
o Feature: Added envp data to intputdatastorage if execve() is used. Prepared
    for future inputs to consume it.
o Feature: Created snoopy-enable and snoopy-disable system scripts.

o Distro packaging: added debian/ubuntu packaging data (by Sebastien Gross)
o Distro packaging: added rhel/centos package spec file (by Jeremy Brown)

o Refactoring: Separated data gathering into separate functions, to be
    used at will - now they are called "input providers"
o Refactoring: Removed external filtering, to be replaced with internal
    filtering capability in the making
o Refactoring: Removed logging exclusion via prefix, was created for
    exclusion of logging of external filter commands
o Refactoring: switched to autotools completely
o Refactoring: all builds now use -Wall and -Werror
o Refactoring: removed --enable-cwd-logging (superseded by message formatting
    options and input provider)
o Refactoring: Snoopy library is now called libsnoopy.so instead of snoopy.so,
    to conform to autotools syntax
o Refactoring: ./configure: removed many bugs, added proper syntax and error
    messages to help user decide what she wants
o Refactoring: added 'proper' (unified) error handling
o Refactoring: moved input testing to separate executable, which does not get
    installed, but is only intended for development/debugging
o Refactoring: created proper initialization/shutdown methods

o Documentation: added into about writing new input providers
o Bugfix: fixed compilation failure on debian in inputs/cwd.c (thanks Sébastien Gross)
o Bugfix: missing snoopy.ini in distribution tarball (thanks Jeremy Brown)
o Bugfix: When uninstalling, also disable Snoopy (remove from /etc/ld.so.preload).


2013-04-06 - Version  1.9.0
---------------------------
o Bugfix: fixed bug with unclosed /dev/log descriptor which caused hangs
o Feature: System-dependent exec() argument length support added (thanks Jeff Schroeder)

---------------------------
o Feature: syslog facility is now configurable
o Feature: syslog level is now configurable
o Feature: external filter support available
o Feature: single path prefix filtering available


2010-10-10 - Version  1.7.10
---------------------------

2010-10-10 - Version  1.7.6
---------------------------
o Quick fix of buggy patch applied in previous release


2010-10-10 - Version  1.7.5
---------------------------
o Build for 64bit machines and destdir support for RPMs (Aldemira)
o Fixed 1-byte memory leak introduced in previous release


2010-09-24 - Version  1.7.2
---------------------------
o Logs current tty (initial patch provided by Aldemira user on SourceForge)


2010-02-11 - Version  1.6.1
---------------------------
o Logs current working directory


2010-02-09 - Version  1.6.0
---------------------------
o Uses autotools now

o Rewritten logging function to avoid memory leaks
o No more segfaults on 64bit platforms
o Program name and argument lengths limited to 4096 bytes
o Many thanks to otheus for supplying a patch on SourceForge one and a half 
    years ago, it helped tremendously.


2010-02-09 - Version  1.5.0
---------------------------
o Updated to compile and work without segfaults on 32bit and 64bit platforms
o Project maintenance taken over by Bostjan Skufca


Sun December 10 - Version  1.3
------------------------------
o Altered logging mechanism for performance
o Added new way of logging (can choose)

  notifying us!


Thu October 10 - Version  1.2
-----------------------------
o Fixed small bug with rather adverse side effects. 


Thu August 17 - Version  1.1
----------------------------
o Added support for execv().  Although execv() calls execve()
  [as described in the man page], execv() calls don't seem to log.
  They now do.  Will investigate this issue a bit further.
o Made logging code modular, as to accomodate for the extra 
  overload that execv() brought.


Thu August 3  - Version 1.00
----------------------------
o Cleaned up the codebase a bit
o Added the output of username and sid (PID of the login shell) 
  to the logged output
o Fixed install.sh to be compatible with older (v1.0) bash shells
