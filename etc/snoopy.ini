;;; Log Message Format specification
;
; May consist of:
; - arbitrary text, which is copied to log message as-is,
; - calls to input providers without arguments: %{input}
; - calls to input providers with    argument : %{input:arg1}
; - calls to input providers with    arguments: %{input:arg1,arg2}   <--- if input provider supports it
;
; List of input providers:
; - %{cmdline}        ; Full command line, with arguments
; - %{cwd}            ; Current working directory
; - %{egid}           ; Effective gid that executed the command
; - %{egroup}         ; Effective group name that executed the command
; - %{env:VAR}        ; Environmental variable named 'VAR'
; - %{env_all}        ; All environmental varibles, comma separated
; - %{euid}           ; Effective uid that executed the command
; - %{eusername}      ; Effective username that executed the command
; - %{filename}       ; Full path to executable
; - %{gid}            ; Group id that executed the command
; - %{group}          ; Group name that executed the command
; - %{login}          ; Login name (tries getlogin_r() first, then SUDO_USER env variabe, and LOGNAME env as last resort)
; - %{ppid}           ; Parent process ID of process that executed the command
; - %{pid}            ; ID of process that executed the command
; - %{sid}            ; Process id of session group process leader
; - %{snoopy_version} ; Snoopy version
; - %{tty}            ; Which TTY the command was run on
; - %{tty_uid}        ; TTY uid
; - %{tty_username}   ; TTY username
; - %{uid}            ; User id that executed the command
; - %{username}       ; Username that executed the command
;
; Default value:
;   "[uid:%{uid} sid:%{sid} tty:%{tty} cwd:%{cwd} filename:%{filename}]: %{cmdline}"
;
; Example:
;message_format = "useless static log entry that gets logged on every program execution"
;message_format = "[uid:%{uid} sid:%{sid} tty:%{tty} cwd:%{cwd} filename:%{filename}]: %{cmdline}"



;;; Filter Chain specification
;
; Example definitions:
; - filter_chain = "exclude_uid:0"       # Log all commands, except the ones executed by root
; - filter_chain = "exclude_uid:1,2,3"   # Log all commands, except those executed by users with UIDs 1, 2 and 3
; - filter_chain = "only_uid:0"          # Log only root commands
; - filter_chain = "filter1:arg11;filter2:arg21,arg22;filter3:arg31,32,33"
;
; Here you have four filter definitions for your reference, they are
; quite self-explanatory. As you probably noted in the last example,
; multiple filters may be defined in a chain, separated by semicolon.
;
; Each filter chains can contain multiple filter definitions. They are
; processed in order of appearance. If any of the filters decides the
; message should be dropped, the filter chain processing is immediately
; interrupted and message is not passed to syslog.
;
; If filter requires an argument, they may be passed to them by
; specifying a colon after filter name, followed by an argument.
; Argument is passed to the filter as-is. If passing of multiple
; arguments to filter is required, they are passed as single string
; and must be parsed/tokenized by the filter itself (see "only_uid"
; filter for example).
;
; Filter chain specification may not contain any spaces.
; (Acutally spaces are allowed in arguments, but not in filter names
; and between semicolons and filter names, nor between filter names
; and following colons.)
;
; Default value:
;   "" (empty string)
;
; Examples:
;filter_chain = ""
;filter_chain = "only_uid:0"
;filter_chain = "only_uid:10000"
;filter_chain = "exclude_uid:0"



;;; Output
;
; Where messages get sent to
;
; Possible options:
; - devlog   ; default
; - syslog   ; previuosly-default (WARNING: DO NOT USE syslog VALUE WITH systemd - IT WILL HANG YOUR SYSTEM ON BOOT)
;
; Options pending implementation (patches welcome!):
; - console                           ; TODO
; - file:/absolute/path/to/file       ; TODO (missing path configuration too)
; - journald                          ; TODO
; - socket:/absolute/path/to/socket   ; TODO (missing path configuration too)
;
; Default value:
;   devlog
;   (previously 'syslog' was default value, but due to systemd issues default was changed)
;   (to raw device writing as syslogd blocks syslog() calls if journald is not running)
;
; Example:
;output = console



;;; Error Logging
;
; Whether to log error messages or not.
; This should generally be disabled, as it may generate lots of error logs.
;
; The most appropriate usage of this parameter is when:
; - you are developing new input provider
; - you are trying to configure message format and are having problems with it
;
; Default value:
;   no (unless changed by ./configure --enable-error-logging to yes)
;
; Example:
;error_logging = yes



;;; Syslog Facility
;
; What syslog facility to use. Can be prefixed with 'LOG_'.
;
; Possible values:
;   One of AUTH|AUTHPRIV|CRON|DAEMON|FTP|KERN|LOCAL[0-7]|LPR|MAIL|NEWS|SYSLOG|USER|UUCP
;
; Default value:
;   LOG_AUTHPRIV (unless changed by ./configure --with-syslog-facility=FACILITY)
;
; Example:
;syslog_facility = LOG_AUTHPRIV



;;; Syslog Level
;
; What syslog level to use. Can be prefixed with 'LOG_'.
;
; Possible values:
;   One of EMERG|ALERT|CRIT|ERR|WARNING|NOTICE|INFO|DEBUG
;
; Default value:
;   LOG_INFO (unless changed by ./configure --with-syslog-level=LEVEL)
;
; Example:
;syslog_level = LOG_INFO
